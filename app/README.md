# Daffy Darja: The App
Started drafting the implementation.
I'm trying to make something minimal but functional.

Probably gonna use Meteor + VueJS. And either Vuetify or Spectre.CSS.

The whole thing can be seen as a regular forum where people submit posts (English) and people comment (Darja) and react... Something like [Microscope][] (It's what you get after you finish the nicely written book Discover Meteor. I advise you to check it out if you're curious about Meteor).
