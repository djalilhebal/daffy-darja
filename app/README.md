# Daffy Darja: The App
Trying to make something minimal but functional.

Probably gonna use VueJS and Vuetify (or Spectre.CSS), and Meteor or something...

The whole thing can be seen as a regular forum where people submit posts (in English) and people comment (in Darja) and react to them... Something like [Microscope](https://github.com/DiscoverMeteor/Microscope) (It's what you get after you finish the nicely written book Discover Meteor. I advise you to check it out if you're curious about Meteor).

Check the `microscope-based/` folder for a rough implementation of what I'm hoping to make.

Check [Trash](https://github.com/dreamski21/trash) for some drafts (like **wilaya-input** and **user-profile**).
